# darktable-styles

My styles for the [darktable](http://www.darktable.org/) raw developer. 

* **film emulation:** Various styles to emulate the look of analog film via the color look up module.  All these styles are based on [G'MIC film emulation](http://gmic.eu/film_emulation/index.shtml).  They come in two flavours, one with 24 color patches and one with 49 color patches.  The color look up module can only approximate the effect of G'MIC film emulation.  The flavour with 49 patches might be a more accurate approcimation of the G'MIC film emulation.  The styles should be applied to processed JPEG files or to RAW files with a suitable active base curve.

* **for Sony:** Various styles for processing RAW files of Sony cameras.
